Trouble shooting

In general, when you get a warning message, it will be because the format of your data is wrong.

- Check the data structure of each vector in your data.frame.

> sapply(dataframe, class)
     plot       tag       dbh    height   density      year     month       day    plot.1       agC 
 "factor" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric"  "factor" "numeric" 

- If they are all "numeric", make sure you don't have numbers and letters in your data (e.g. if a tag is 2A, it will be converted to NA).

Warning messages:
1: In cen$agC[ii] <- (bm) * (1/(2.1097 * 1000)) :
  number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length
