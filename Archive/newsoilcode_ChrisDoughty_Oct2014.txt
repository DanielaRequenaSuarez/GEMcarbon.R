# Questions from meeting with Dan, Terhi, Walter, Norma, Chris, Yadvinder (03/11/2011)

-Is there a consistent trend in how fluxes change over time after installation?

-When do the data start and stop becoming useful?

-What are the time series and patterns of variability?

-Do we see evidence of clear waterlogging (decline in respiration of heterotrophic respiration)?



# Tube Definitions 
# 1)	Surface tubes (Ts): Three tubes inserted ~ 2 cm into the soil surface
# 2)	Deep mesh tubes (Tdm): Three tubes each with four windows (3 x 3 cm) covered with fine mesh (41 µm aperture), to exclude fine roots but allow entry by mycorrhizae (Heinemeyer et al. 2007)
# 3)	Deep solid tubes (Tds): Three tubes inserted to 30 cm depth into the soil with no lateral entry points, to exclude both roots and mycorrhizae.
 
# Within each set of three, each tube has a different litter layer treatment (ambient litter- Tsal, Tdmal, Tdsal; no litter- Tsnl, Tdmnl, Tdsnl; double litter- Tsdl, Tdmdl, Tdsdl).

# con_nor_litA  = surface tube (Ts) - normal litter - Tsal
# con_no_litA   = surface tube (Ts) - no litter  - Tsnl
# con_doub_litA = surface tube (Ts) - double litter -Tsdl
# My_nor_litA   = Deep mesh tubes (Tdm) - normal litter - Tdmal
# My_no_litA    = Deep mesh tubes (Tdm) - no litter - Tdmnl
# My_doub_litA  = Deep mesh tubes (Tdm) - double litter -Tdmdl
# So_nor_litA   = Deep solid tubes (Tds)- normal litter - Tdsal
# So_no_litA    = Deep solid tubes (Tds) - no litter - Tdsnl
# So_doub_litA  = Deep solid tubes (Tds) - double litter - Tdsdl

# Calculations
# Each month, a mean disturbance-induced flux (D) is calculated as:

D = Td – Tud  
# Decide on how we estimate discorA? In the current code, this is (mean of Td) - (mean of Tud).
# disturbance may reduce or increase respiration (Cax problem?).

#  Control - normal litterfall
#  Control - no litterfall
#  Control - double litterfall
#  Mycorrhizae - normal litterfall
#  Mycorrhizae - no litterfall
#  Mycorrhizae - double litterfall
#  Soil - normal litterfall
#  Soil - no litterfall
#  Soil - double litterfall

# This flux is then included when calculating CO2 flux contributions from the different components as the # difference in CO2 efflux from the tubes:
# Root respiration = Ts – (Tdm – D)
# Mycorrhizal respiration = (Tdm – D) – (Tds – D)
# Soil organic matter respiration = Tds – D
# Effects of litter addition on litter respiration are assessed by calculating this component twice – from # double litter (Rldl) and no-litter (Rlnl) compared to ambient litter tubes:
# Rlnl = (Tdsal – D) – (Tdsnl – D)
# Rldl = (Tdsdl – D) – (Tdsal – D)

# For the purposes of these calculations, all CO2 flux terms were quantified in the same units. 

# root respiration Ts – (Tdm – D)
rrA1 <- ((con_nor_litA + con_no_litA + con_doub_litA) / 3) - (((My_nor_litA + My_no_litA + My_doub_litA) / 3) - discorA)

# set thresholds
rrA1(find(rrA1<0)) <- 0/0
rrA1(find(rrA1>3)) <- 0/0

# Mycorrhizal respiration = (Tdm – D) – (Tds – D)
MrA1 = (((My_nor_litA + My_no_litA + My_doub_litA) / 3) - discorA) - (((So_nor_litA + So_no_litA + So_doub_litA)/3)-discorA)

# Effects of litter addition on litter respiration are assessed by calculating this component twice – from double # litter (Rldl) and no-litter (Rlnl) compared to ambient litter tubes:
# Rlnl = (Tdsal – D) – (Tdsnl – D)
RlnlA = (So_nor_litA - discorA) - (So_no_litA - discorA)

# Rldl = (Tdsdl – D) – (Tdsal – D)
RldlA = (So_doub_litA - discorA) - (So_nor_litA - discorA)


??? How about standard deviations?
